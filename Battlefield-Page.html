                A class system is present within all the Battlefield games. Each class features a different type of primary weapon along with 
                different equipment, differentiating roles on the battlefield. The ability to engage other players in melee 
                combat with a knife has been present in Battlefield games. Since Battlefield 2142, the 
                series has included an award of dog tags for each player killed using a knife.
